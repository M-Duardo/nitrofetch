== Add new logos

First of, you need to add plain text ascii art to src/logos with the name of
the logo.

Then you need to go to the last lines of src/Logo.zig, and add the following to the 
`logos`:

[source][zig]
=============
...
    .{ "distro_id", @embedFile("logos/distro_id.ascii") },
...
=============

`distro_id` being ID field from your distro's `/etc/os-release`.
